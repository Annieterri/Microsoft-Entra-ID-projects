# ðŸ”‘ Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration and management of **Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** to implement **Just-In-Time (JIT)** privileged access.  
The goal is to enhance **identity governance**, reduce **standing administrative permissions**, and align with **Zero Trust** and **least privilege** principles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Enable and configure **PIM** for Azure AD roles (and optionally Azure Resource roles).  
- Implement **approval workflows** and **activation notifications**.  
- Enforce **time-bound access** with MFA and justification requirements.  
- Conduct **access reviews** for continuous privilege validation.  
- Monitor and audit privileged role usage.
