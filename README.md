# Microsoft-Entra-ID-projects
This repository showcases my hands-on projects that i have completed on Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD with a focus on Identity & and Access Management (IAM), Zero Trust security, automation, and passwordless authentication, conditional access and password policies e.t.c. Each project includes a detailed case study, screenshots, and, where applicable, scripts or diagrams.


## Projects Included

### 1.  Conditional Access & MFA  
- Designed and implemented secure access policies to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
- Focused on user risk, device compliance, and session control to align with Zero Trust principles.

### 2.  Privileged Identity Management (PIM)  
- Implemented Just-In-Time (JIT) access for privileged roles.  
- Enforced approval workflows, role activation alerts, and access reviews for high-privilege accounts.

### 3.  User Provisioning Automation  
- Automated onboarding and offboarding using PowerShell and Microsoft Graph API.  
- Streamlined user lifecycle management and reduced manual administrative tasks.

### 4.  FIDO2 Passkeys / Passwordless Authentication  
- Deployed passwordless authentication using FIDO2 security keys and Windows Hello for Business.  
- Enhanced security posture while improving the user sign-in experience.

### 5.  Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)  
- Configured and tested SSPR with MFA to empower users to reset passwords securely.  
- Ensured alignment with organizational compliance and recovery policies.

### 6.  Identity Protection & Risk-Based Policies  
- Configured Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect risky sign-ins and compromised accounts.  
- Built automated responses to enforce step-up authentication or account blocking.  
- Integrated sign-in risk and user risk detections into Conditional Access policies.

### 7.  External Identities (B2B Collaboration)  
- Set up B2B guest access for external vendors or partners.  
- Applied Conditional Access and access review policies for guest lifecycle management.  
- Customized invitation redemption and terms of use for external users.

### 8.  Entra ID Connect / Hybrid Identity Integration  
- Implemented Azure AD Connect for hybrid identity synchronization.  
- Enabled Seamless SSO, Password Hash Sync, and device writeback.  
- Tested scenarios for hybrid join and Entra ID join with managed and federated domains.

### 9.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Least Privilege  
- Designed custom roles and role assignments aligned with the principle of least privilege.  
- Documented role mapping for IT admins, application owners, and helpdesk users.  
- Implemented Access Reviews to continuously validate user permissions.

### 10.  Monitoring & Audit with Entra Logs  
- Integrated Sign-in logs and Audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel for real-time monitoring.  
- Created KQL queries to detect anomalous logins, risky role activations, and failed MFA attempts.  
- Built a Sentinel workbook to visualize identity activity and risks.
