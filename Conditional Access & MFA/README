# Conditional Access & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of Conditional Access (CA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).  
The goal is to enforce Zero Trust access control, verifying user identity, device health, and session context before granting access to corporate resources.

---

## Objectives
- Enforce MFA for all users accessing Microsoft 365 and Azure resources.
- Block legacy authentication protocols.
- Apply access controls based on user risk, location, and device compliance.
- Implement break-glass accounts and emergency access procedures.
- Test and document user experience across different access conditions.

---

##  Concepts Covered
- Conditional Access Policies
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- User Risk & Sign-In Risk
- Named Locations & Device Compliance
- Zero Trust Principles: Verify Explicitly, Least Privilege, Assume Breach
